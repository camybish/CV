## Work Experience

**Pier Pressure, Brighton BN1** (Oct' 22 to Date)  
_Games Host_

- My role at Pier Pressure consists of two main tasks: introducing the players to the room and guiding them through an escape room to give them the best chance of winning
- The introduction is done in character, an apt character for the corresponding room. I would bring them in, warm them up to the experience and give them the rundown of how to ask for help and what they are there to solve. 
- The guiding is of course where the complexity comes in. You have a certain number of puzzles in the given room and a time window for completing those puzzles to give them the best chance of winning.
    - Your tools are hints and clues to ensure a good flow through the structure of the game. No one wants to spend 15 minutes on a puzzle so you help accordingly
    - Once they are done, regardless of their result, you praise their strengths as a team through various stamps so that whatever the case they leave satisfied

**Engage Education, Brighton BN1 (Agency Full-time)** (Nov’ 21 to Mar' 23)  
_Teaching Assistant_

- My contract with Engage Education involves working in various schools across Brighton and Hove to support and supplement learning for individual children and groups. - This covered children from ages 2 to 16 who have various challenges, including learning difficulties and behavioral problems. My role was to encourage engagement and ensure they participate at whatever level is required of them.
- For 7 months, I worked at The Burgess Hill Academy which was the final school I was contracted at. At this particular school, I got to hone in on all the skills I had developed at that point. This included:
    - Emotional Support
    - Recontextualising problems in a simpler-to-understand way
    - Helping children keep pace in what can be, for them, an incredibly fast-paced learning environment
    - Being observant of any extra difficulties they may be having that aren't already documented
    - Importantly, talking to them on their level so that they're as receptive to your help and the material as they can be 
- I also spent 6 weeks at Reflections Nursery in Worthing in which I learnt a great deal about, what Ofsted deems, their “Outstanding” methods of enriching the development of young children. I worked as an early years educator for 45 hours a week, learning their version of the Reggio Amelia approach which fosters children's innate curiosity for the world.

**Peacocks Ltd** (May 19 to Mar' 21)  
_Sales Assistant_

- As a member of the Peacocks team, my job ranged from working on the tills to managing all manner of customer queries and purchases. Actively processing apparel to be unpacked, tagged and presented on the shop floor.

**Fox in a Box, Dalston E8** (May 19 to Aug' 19)
_Games Master_

- Before I worked at Pier Pressure, I worked here and as well as running games and assisting players, I also had a hand in designing the experience of the games. In particular their Zodiac Killer escape room. The company had more of a scary side to it than Pier Pressure, especially with this room, so my role involved tweaking the user experience for the room as it premiered in the UK. This involved upping the fear factor for players in a way that would give them an experience true to the room while keeping them engaged with the material of the room

**Lee McCormack Design** (Aug' 18 to Jun' 19)  
_Intern_

- I completed a 25-week work placement at Lee McCormack Design where I learned practical design skills working on a new product. This involved e-sports market research, presenting concepts and products to clients, using app wire-framing, and storyboarding.

## Skills

IT Skills - Gained from my Degree
- Proficient in SolidWorks, Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, and Marvel plus a basic understanding of Proteus (circuitry design software). I am also a highly competent user of Microsoft Office products.

((Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.))

((Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevant to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.))


Here's an example

#### Communication

Recently I've worked on further improving my skills in team environments at Makers. In the AceBook project, ...

One of the biggest developments in my communication skills came from my work at Pier Pressure. Each shift provided a new way to hone in my introduction and process throughout the game to give players the best experience possible, whether that be by perfecting my presentation abilities in the introduction speech or providing clues that provided a good challenge for players and stayed true to the theme of the room. This also bought challenges with being improvisational to accommodate the different help needed for teams. 

What set me up for utilising such abilities was my work as a Learning Support Assistant. As I was working with children with different educational needs at all different ages, I needed to be very adaptive in my approach. Some children would require a high-energy approach to grab their attention, and others would need some time to adjust to my presence before offering advice and support on the work they were doing. I value the work I did and the learning process I went through immensely. 

Example Below 
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some online evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jan' 23 to Date)
- Makers Academy provides an intensive course to provide you with the skills to become a junior developer with Full Stack experience
- Throughout the course, we did plenty of practice exercises independently and through pair programming which you can peruse on my GitHub account
- Improving my resolve was probably one of the biggest personal skills I got to develop. Coding can sometimes feel overwhelming but when working as a team, using the right resources can get you consistently improving and progressing in ways that surprise yourself
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problem solve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- More technical skills/knowledge listed below: 
- Ruby, JavaScript, React, Jest, 
- RSpec

#### **BSc Product Design - Bournemouth University**  (Sept ‘16 - July ‘21)

- My degree course is professionally accredited by the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED) and fulfils requirements for Chartered Technological Product Designer (CTPD).
- Over the course of my degree, I have covered a range of topics from material technologies to sustainability issues. Using computer aided design and analysis simulation tools along with engineering drawings producing my own unique products in the workshop studio.
- My dissertation project was a great encapsulation of my creative spirit and lead me to create a toy for toddlers that worked at building communication and imaginative real-world play.
    - This came in the form of a toy that blended the timeless creativity of wooden trainsets and dollhouses. You can see this in detail on my Product Design portfolio linked here: https://cameronjamesbishop.wixsite.com/home 

#### Any other qualifications

- CPD Level 2 Teaching Assistant - Higher Distinction
- JSLA – Distinction
- B-Tech – IT – Distinction
- Piano & Music Theory up to and including Grade 5

((That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person))

## Hobbies

- Bouldering
    - Bouldering is really a puzzle. How do you take full advantage of the wall in front of you in order to get to the top? Learning how to make the most of complicated holes and trusting your abilities to take steps you didn't think you could
    
- Journaling
    - Journaling as well as some other forms of writing have helped me to continually develop my communication skills and have helped give me the interesting writing challenge of making the mundane moments exciting to read about. 

((Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team))
