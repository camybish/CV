## Work Experience

**Pier Pressure, Brighton BN1** (Oct' 22 to Date)  
_Games Host_

- With my role at Pier Pressure, it consists of two main tasks: introducing the players to the room and guiding them through an escape room to give them the best chance of winning
- The introduction is done in character, an apt character for the corresponding room. I would bring them in, warm them up to the experience and give them the rundown of how to ask for help and what they are there to solve. 
- The guiding is of course where the complexity comes in. You have a certain number of puzzles in the given room and time window for completing those puzzles go give them the best chance of winning.
    - Your tools are hints and clues to ensure a good flow through the structure of the game. No one wants to spend 15 minutes on a puzzle so you help accordingly
    - Once they are done, regardless of their result, you praise their strengths as a team through various stamps so that whatever the case they leave satisfied

**Engage Education, Brighton BN1 (Agency Full-time)** (Nov’ 21 to Mar' 23)  
_Teaching Assistant_

- My contract with Engage Education involves working in various schools across Brighton and Hove to support and supplement learning for individual children and groups. - This covered children from ages 2 to 16 who have various challenges, including learning difficulties and behavioural problems. My role was to encourage engagement and ensure they participate at whatever level is required of them.
- For 7 months, I worked to The Burgess Hill Academy which was the final school I was contracted at. At this particular school, I got to hone in on all the skills I had developed at that point. This included:
    - Emotional Support
    - Recontextualising problems in a simpler-to-understand way
    - Helping children keep pace in what can be, for them, an incredibly fast paced learning environment
    - Being observant to any extra difficulties they may be having that aren't already documented
    - Importantly, talking to them on their level so that they're as receptive to your help and the material as they can be 
- I also spent 6 weeks at Reflections Nursery in Worthing in which I learnt a great deal about, what Ofsted deems, their “Outstanding” methods of enriching the development of young children. I worked as an early years educator for 45 hours a week, learning their version of the Reggio Amelia approach which fosters children's innate curiosity for the world.

**Peacocks Ltd** (May 19 to Mar' 21)  
_Sales Assistant_

- As a member of the Peacocks team, my job ranged from working on the tills to managing allmanner of customer queries and purchases. Actively processing apparel to be unpacked, tagged and presented on the shop floor.


**Lee McCormack Design** (Aug' 18 to Jun' 19)  
_Intern_

- I have completed a 25 week work placement at Lee McCormack Design where I learnt practical design skills working on a new product. This involved e-sports market research, presenting concepts and products to clients, using app wire-framing, and storyboarding.

## Skills

Degree IT Skills
- Proficient in SolidWorks, Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, Marvel plus a basic understanding of Proteus (circuitry design software). I am also a highly competent user of Microsoft Office products.

((Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.))

((Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.))


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Any other qualifications

((That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person))

## Hobbies

- Bouldering
    - Bouldering is really a puzzle. How do you take full advantage of the wall in front of you in order to get to the top? Learning how to make the most of complicated holes and trusting your abilities to take steps you didn't think you could

((Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team))
