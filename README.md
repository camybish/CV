## Work Experience

**Pier Pressure, Brighton BN1** (Oct' 22 to Date)  
_Games Host_

- My role at Pier Pressure consists of two main tasks: introducing the players to the room and guiding them through an escape room to give them the best chance of winning
- The introduction is done in character, an apt character for the corresponding room. I would bring them in, warm them up to the experience and give them the rundown of how to ask for help and what they are there to solve. 
- The guiding is of course where the complexity comes in. You have a certain number of puzzles in the given room and a time window for completing those puzzles to give them the best chance of winning.
    - Your tools are hints and clues to ensure a good flow through the structure of the game. No one wants to spend 15 minutes on a puzzle so you help accordingly
    - Once they are done, regardless of their result, you praise their strengths as a team through various stamps so that whatever the case they leave satisfied

**Engage Education, Brighton BN1 (Agency Full-time)** (Nov’ 21 to Mar' 23)  
_Teaching Assistant_

- My contract with Engage Education involves working in various schools across Brighton and Hove to support and supplement learning for individual children and groups. - This covered children from ages 2 to 16 who have various challenges, including learning difficulties and behavioral problems. My role was to encourage engagement and ensure they participate at whatever level is required of them.
- For 7 months, I worked at The Burgess Hill Academy which was the final school I was contracted at. At this particular school, I got to hone in on all the skills I had developed at that point. This included:
    - Emotional Support
    - Recontextualising problems in a simpler-to-understand way
    - Helping children keep pace in what can be, for them, an incredibly fast-paced learning environment
    - Being observant of any extra difficulties they may be having that aren't already documented
    - Importantly, talking to them on their level so that they're as receptive to your help and the material as they can be 
- I also spent 6 weeks at Reflections Nursery in Worthing where I learned a great deal about, what Ofsted deems, their “Outstanding” methods of enriching the development of young children. I worked as an early years educator for 45 hours a week, learning their version of the Reggio Amelia approach which fosters children's innate curiosity for the world.

**Peacocks Ltd** (May 19 to Mar' 21)  
_Sales Assistant_

- As a member of the Peacocks team, my job ranged from working on the tills to managing all manner of customer queries and purchases. Actively processing apparel to be unpacked, tagged and presented on the shop floor.

**Fox in a Box, Dalston E8** (May 19 to Aug' 19)
_Games Master_

- Before I worked at Pier Pressure, I worked here and as well as running games and assisting players, I also had a hand in designing the experience of the games. In particular their Zodiac Killer escape room. The company had more of a scary side to it than Pier Pressure, especially with this room, so my role involved tweaking the user experience for the room as it premiered in the UK. This involved upping the fear factor for players in a way that would give them an experience true to the room while keeping them engaged with the material of the room

**Lee McCormack Design** (Aug' 18 to Jun' 19)  
_Intern_

- I completed a 25-week work placement at Lee McCormack Design where I learned practical design skills working on a new product. This involved e-sports market research, presenting concepts and products to clients, using app wire-framing, and storyboarding.

## Skills

IT Skills - Gained from my Degree
- Proficient in SolidWorks, Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, and Marvel plus a basic understanding of Proteus (circuitry design software). I am also a highly competent user of Microsoft Office products. In terms of computer programming, I'm practised in:

- Ruby, RSpec & Sinatra (example shown here https://wills-test-on-the-web.onrender.com/ )
- JavaScript & Jest
- Mongoose, Express, React & Node.js
- TDD, Agile Development + Git & GitHub

#### Communication

One of the biggest developments in my communication skills came from my work at Pier Pressure. Each shift provided a new way to hone in my introduction and process throughout the game to give players the best experience possible, whether that be by perfecting my presentation abilities in the introduction speech or providing clues that provided a good challenge for players and stayed true to the theme of the room. This also bought challenges with being improvisational to accommodate the different help needed for teams. 

What set me up for utilising such abilities was my work as a Learning Support Assistant. As I was working with children with different educational needs at all different ages, I needed to be very adaptive in my approach. Some children would require a high-energy approach to grab their attention, and others would need some time to adjust to my presence before offering advice and support on the work they were doing. I value the work I did and the learning process I went through immensely. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jan' 23 to Date)
- Makers Academy provides an intensive course to provide you with the skills to become a junior developer with Full Stack experience
- Throughout the course, we did plenty of practice exercises independently and through pair programming which you can peruse on my GitHub account
- Improving my resolve was probably one of the biggest personal skills I got to develop. Coding can sometimes feel overwhelming but when working as a team and using the right resources can get you consistently improving and progressing in ways that surprise yourself
- Once we spent two months getting acquainted with the fundamentals of Ruby, the course started with an intensity of learning that I had never seen before. Within two and a half months, we had gone from learning the fundamentals of Test Driven Development to working in an 8 person team to make a full stack MERN web app and more.
- Within that time we frequently used pairing in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication. Thanks to the frequency of this, it got me more comfortable in asking my peers for help with concepts I didn't quite understand. I'm sure coding as a skill is something that you continually improve your understanding of, so I appreciate Makers for giving me the space to improve on this and plenty of other working methods. The pomodoro work schedule helped a fair deal as well, giving us frequent breaks that kept us fresh and ready for the hefty tasks we were undertaking.

- We used:
    - **Ruby and RSpec** to get us started and accustomed to TDD, then building on this with **PostgreSQL and Sinatra** to build websites with their own databases
    - After gaining confidence with these programs, we moved on to **JavaScript** and **Jest** to make the most of the more complex web scenarios that JavaScript works wonders with. These included making algorithms that utilized APIs and using DOM elements.
    - This led us well into using the **MERN** stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js) to create a Facebook clone website as a way of getting accustomed.
 
- Throughout the Sinatra web app, the Facebook clone, and the final project, we realized as a cohort and within our respective teams, how important communication and planning are when bringing something like this together. Utilizing an Agile working environment, setting out a team charter before starting, and working within the tickets of each sprint; These were processes that our cohort worked to continually improve, and the more we did, the happier we were with the results. 

#### **BSc Product Design - Bournemouth University**  (Sept ‘16 - July ‘21)

- My degree course is professionally accredited by the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED) and fulfils requirements for Chartered Technological Product Designer (CTPD).
- Over the course of my degree, I have covered a range of topics from material technologies to sustainability issues. Using computer aided design and analysis simulation tools along with engineering drawings producing my own unique products in the workshop studio.
- My dissertation project was a great encapsulation of my creative spirit and lead me to create a toy for toddlers that worked at building communication and imaginative real-world play.
    - This came in the form of a toy that blended the timeless creativity of wooden trainsets and dollhouses. You can see this in detail on my Product Design portfolio linked here: https://cameronjamesbishop.wixsite.com/home 

#### Any other qualifications

- CPD Level 2 Teaching Assistant - Higher Distinction
- JSLA – Distinction
- B-Tech – IT – Distinction
- Piano & Music Theory up to and including Grade 5

## Hobbies

- Bouldering
    - Bouldering is really a puzzle. How do you take full advantage of the wall in front of you in order to get to the top? Learning how to make the most of complicated holes and trusting your abilities to take steps you didn't think you could
    
- Journaling
    - Journaling as well as some other forms of writing have helped me to continually develop my communication skills and have helped give me the interesting writing challenge of making the mundane moments exciting to read about.
