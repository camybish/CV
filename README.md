## Cameron Bishop

As a calm and dedicated individual, I am eager to take the next step in my career in the tech industry. I’ve spent the last 2 years in Education and Hospitality across many roles but I’m ready to make the change. I find programming to be a very rewarding skill, utilising my problem-solving and critical thinking skills to make something new appear on a page is invigorating & I’m excited to develop this knowledge further.

## Skills

IT Skills - Gained from my Degree
- Proficient in SolidWorks, Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, and Marvel plus a basic understanding of Proteus (circuitry design software). I am also a highly competent user of Microsoft Office products. In terms of computer programming, I'm practised in:

- Ruby, RSpec & Sinatra (example shown here https://wills-test-on-the-web.onrender.com/ )
- JavaScript & Jest
- Mongoose, Express, React & Node.js
- TDD, Agile Development + Git & GitHub

#### Communication

One of the biggest developments in my communication skills came from my work at Pier Pressure. Each shift provided a new way to hone in my introduction and process throughout the game to give players the best experience possible, whether that be by perfecting my presentation abilities in the introduction speech or providing clues that provided a good challenge for players and stayed true to the theme of the room. This also bought challenges with being improvisational to accommodate the different help needed for teams. 

What set me up for utilising such abilities was my work as a Learning Support Assistant. As I was working with children with different educational needs at all different ages, I needed to be very adaptive in my approach. Some children would require a high-energy approach to grab their attention, and others would need some time to adjust to my presence before offering advice and support on the work they were doing. I value the work I did and the learning process I went through immensely. 

#### Emotional Intelligence

What I've done as a Learning Support Assistant, has greatly improved my emotional intelligence. When working in schools, my role required an incredible level of empathy to ensure children complete what is expected of them. In order to do this, you need to build a connection. Many children, especially in secondary schools are jaded to staff intervention, so a good connection, found from trying many many methods, and plenty of empathy was essential. 

#### Team Player

I have worked and team environments before this, but I feel that my time at Makers Academy was a fantastic showcase of how well I can work in a team environment. I feel that the best example of this was my work on the final project, Battle Tetris. For this final project, we settled on my idea for a Tetris clone that is played between two people on the same grid. With this being my idea, I felt I had a level of responsibility to ensure that this gets made with great care and presented as such at the end of the 2 weeks; so I took charge of the initial conception stage. Since none of us had made a game before, I decided that the first week of this project should be dedicated to figuring out how to make a game engine with technologies that we are familiar with. It took a day to deliberate our strategy but of course, this wasn't smooth sailing. After the first week, we had a game engine but not quite our Minimum Viable Product (movable falling pieces). 

If you want to know more about the process of making Battle Tetris you can watch our presentation using this link: https://youtu.be/poiWhBTU_ys?t=1924

We decided collectively to have a rotation of team leaders and bring in ideas through votes. Overall in this and other projects, I feel that I can be quite dynamic in taking leadership when it is needed, as well as stepping back to allow other voices to come forward.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jan' 23 to Date)
- Makers Academy provides an intensive course to provide you with the skills to become a junior developer with Full Stack experience
- Throughout the course, we did plenty of practice exercises independently and through pair programming which you can peruse on my GitHub account
- Improving my resolve was probably one of the biggest personal skills I got to develop. Coding can sometimes feel overwhelming but when working as a team and using the right resources can get you consistently improving and progressing in ways that surprise yourself
- Once we spent two months getting acquainted with the fundamentals of Ruby, the course started with an intensity of learning that I had never seen before. Within two and a half months, we had gone from learning the fundamentals of Test Driven Development to working in an 8 person team to make a full stack MERN web app and more.
- Within that time we frequently used pairing in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication. Thanks to the frequency of this, it got me more comfortable in asking my peers for help with concepts I didn't quite understand. I'm sure coding as a skill is something that you continually improve your understanding of, so I appreciate Makers for giving me the space to improve on this and plenty of other working methods. The Pomodoro work schedule helped a fair deal as well, giving us frequent breaks that kept us fresh and ready for the hefty tasks we were undertaking.

- We used:
    - **Ruby and RSpec** to get us started and accustomed to TDD, then building on this with **PostgreSQL and Sinatra** to build websites with their own databases
    - After gaining confidence with these programs, we moved on to **JavaScript** and **Jest** to make the most of the more complex web scenarios that JavaScript works wonders with. These included making algorithms that utilized APIs and using DOM elements.
    - This led us well into using the **MERN** stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js) to create a Facebook clone website as a way of getting accustomed.
 
- Throughout the Sinatra web app, the Facebook clone, and the final project, we realized as a cohort and within our respective teams, how important communication and planning are when bringing something like this together. Utilizing an Agile working environment, setting out a team charter before starting, and working within the tickets of each sprint; These were processes that our cohort worked to continually improve, and the more we did, the happier we were with the results. 

#### **BSc Product Design - Bournemouth University**  (Sept ‘16 - July ‘21)

- My degree course is professionally accredited by the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED) and fulfils requirements for Chartered Technological Product Designer (CTPD).
- Over the course of my degree, I have covered a range of topics from material technologies to sustainability issues. Using computer aided design and analysis simulation tools along with engineering drawings producing my own unique products in the workshop studio.
- My dissertation project was a great encapsulation of my creative spirit and lead me to create a toy for toddlers that worked at building communication and imaginative real-world play.
    - This came in the form of a toy that blended the timeless creativity of wooden trainsets and dollhouses. You can see this in detail on my Product Design portfolio linked here: https://cameronjamesbishop.wixsite.com/home 

#### Any other qualifications

- CPD Level 2 Teaching Assistant - Higher Distinction
- JSLA – Distinction
- B-Tech – IT – Distinction
- Piano & Music Theory up to and including Grade 5

## Hobbies

- Bouldering
    - Bouldering is a puzzle. How do you take full advantage of the wall in front of you to get to the top? Learning how to make the most of complicated holes and trusting your abilities to take steps you didn't think you could
    
- Journaling
    - Journaling as well as some other forms of writing have helped me to continually develop my communication skills and have helped give me the interesting writing challenge of making the mundane moments exciting to read about.
